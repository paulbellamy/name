# name

Super-simple golang library for generating friendly Heroku-style names. I've copy-pasted it
around a few projects, and figured it's time to turn it into a proper library.

Some example names:

```
feisty-haze-34
gentle-meadow-66
twilight-silence-38
long-rain-82
summer-lake-10
giant-glade-02
black-moon-92
red-sun-54
still-frog-05
dark-wildflower-69
```
